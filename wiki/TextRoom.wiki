=What is TextRoom?=
*TextRoom* is a free (as in freedom and free beer) full screen text editor developed especially writers in mind.

TextRoom and all other similar editors share one goal: to get you writing right away by providing distraction free environment to your liking, as well as familiar set of keyboard shortcuts to control its behavior. If you don't feel comfortable already with your editor of choice, you may find it useful.
