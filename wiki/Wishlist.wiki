===What Is This?===

This isn't a roadmap, because I suck at following roadmaps. Just my notes and wishes about !TextRoom. I will try to update this page frequently, if I can. If you have any wishes or feature requests for !TextRoom, just leave a comment. 

This page was created on *4.16.2010*.

 <u><b>Underlined Bold</b></u> indicates that I'm *working on* the entry.

===By Priority===

====High====

 * <b>Add spellcheck. (Since we are no more developing for Windows, for now at least.)</b>
 * Add file associations for Gnome, KDE and XFCE at least. (A universal solution would be great.)
 * Make a universal Linux installer with dependency check and uninstaller. (A Bash script of course. More bugs.)

----

====Medium====

 * Add cursor settings.
 * Add line indent feature back. (Find a less resource hungry method.)
 * Make a .txr format with information about files. (Compressed with a properties.xml file? Similar to .odt? CSS? More dependencies?)
 * The above means, add file-specific settings.

----

====Low====

 * <u><b> Add restoring to defaults feature. (QSettings just behave oddly.)</b></u> 
 * <b>Add RTF support? (An html2rtf script? C++ code? Get from word processors? More dependencies?)</b>
 * Add line and paragraph spacing? (Outside Qt? More dependencies?)
 * Add printing support with formatting options. (PDF export? More dependencies?)
 * Add link support.
 * Add image support? (Put the images in compressed .txr?)

----

====Optional====

 * Add a project manager.
 * Add editing multiple documents ability. (Buffers? Tabbed interface?) 
 * Add encryption support. (More dependencies for sure.)

----

====Fancy====

 * Make a proprietary version? (Nah, I don't think so, but I wish. It's possible by the way, Qt and SDL are LGPL.)
 * Add installing and using different sound files feature. (Sound file packages could be separately downloaded.)
 * Add a background picture feature. (Possible in Qt? I guess.)
