=Installation=

==On Ubuntu:==
Just double click the .deb file or open with GDebi Package Installer.

==On Any Distro:==
After download the source code, open up a terminal, cd to the directory which contains the downloaded file and to uncompress, type:

{{{
tar -xzvf ./textroom-xxx.tar.gz 
}}}

xxx is the version number *(e.g. textroom-0.6.1.tar.gz)*. Then cd to the created directory:

{{{
cd ./textroom-xxx 
}}}

It may be only `./textroom` in some versions. And execute the following in order:

{{{
qmake-qt4 (some distros use only qmake)
make
su (enter root password)
make install
}}}

You can start !TextRoom by clicking on the menu entry or typing

{{{
textroom
}}}

=Uninstallation=

==On Ubuntu:==
If you've installed TextRoom from the deb package, there should be an entry in synaptic. But if there isn't you can remove the package by typing 
{{{
sudo apt-get remove textroom
}}}
in a terminal.

==On Any Distro:==
If you've installed from source code, you can do 
{{{
sudo make uninstall
}}}
in the source code directory. If you've removed the source code, you can download and untar the source from the TextRoom site, and in the source directory again 
{{{
qmake-qt4 && make && sudo make uninstall
}}}
