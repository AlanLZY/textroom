= Introduction =

These generic instructions are Linux specific. The editor may or may not work under other operating systems (this is yet to be tested).

To compile TextRoom on Linux, you will need the *Qt4 development libraries (ver. 4.3.2 or later)*. To hear the sounds you will need *nas (ver. 1.9.1 or later)*. 

Windows port includes the necessary libraries.

{{{
tar xzvf ./textroom-xxx.tar.gz
}}}

to unarchive, followed by:

{{{
cd ./textroom-xxx
