===Requirements===

To compile from source you will need the development libraries (they usually have "dev" or "devel" in their names) to:

 * SDL-mixer 1.2.8 (or later) 
 * Hunspell 3.2.06 (or later)

===Installation===

==From Source:==
After downloading the source code, open up a terminal, cd to the directory which contains the downloaded file and to uncompress, type:

{{{
tar -xzvf ./textroom-xxx.tar.gz 
}}}

xxx is the version number *(e.g. textroom-0.6.1.tar.gz)*. Then cd to the created directory:

{{{
cd ./textroom-xxx 
}}}

It may be only `./textroom` in some versions. And execute the following in order:

{{{
qmake
make
sudo make install
make clean
}}}

You can start !TextRoom by clicking on the menu entry or typing

{{{
textroom
}}}

==By Installer==

If you'd like to try the new installer, download the textroom-xxx-installer.bin file (xxx is the version number, e.g 0.6.3). Cd to the directory of the file and run this command:

{{{
./textroom-xxx-installer.bin
}}}

You don't have to su or sudo, installer will ask you when necessary. Ä°nstaller includes file associations and an uninstaller.

===Uninstallation===

==If You've Installed By Installer:==
{{{
textroom-uninstall
}}}

==If You've Installed From Source:==
If you've installed from source code, you can do 
{{{
sudo make uninstall
}}}
in the source code directory. If you've removed the source code, you can download and untar the source from the !TextRoom site, and in the source directory again 
{{{
qmake && make && sudo make uninstall
}}}
