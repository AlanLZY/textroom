===Installation===

===From Source:===
After downloading the source code, open up a terminal, cd to the directory which contains the downloaded file and to uncompress, type:

{{{
tar -xzvf ./textroom-xxx.tar.gz 
}}}

xxx is the version number *(e.g. textroom-0.6.1.tar.gz)*. Then cd to the created directory:

{{{
cd ./textroom-xxx 
}}}

It may be only `./textroom` in some versions. And execute the following in order:

{{{
qmake
make
sudo make install
make clean
}}}

You can start !TextRoom by clicking on the menu entry or typing

{{{
textroom
}}}

===By Installer===

If you'd like to try the new installer, download the textroom-xxx-installer.bin file (xxx is the version number, e.g 0.6.3). Cd to the directory of the file and run this command:

{{{
./textroom-xxx-installer.bin
}}}

You don't have to su or sudo, installer will ask you when necessary. Ä°nstaller includes file associations and an uninstaller.
