= Introduction =

These generic instructions are Linux specific. The editor may or may not work under other operating systems (this is yet to be tested).

To compile TextRoom, you will need the Qt4 development libraries (ver. 4.3.2 or later). 

= Details =

[http://code.google.com/p/textroom/downloads/list Download] the latest version of TextRoom. Drop to command line and type:

{{{
tar xjvf ./textroom-0.2.2.tar.bz2
}}}

to unarchive, followed by:

{{{
cd ./textroom-0.2.2
}}}

Then execute:

{{{
qmake-qt4
}}}

and

{{{
make
}}}

to compile the editor. After successful compilation, you may start the TextRoom simply by typing _bin/textroom_ (not recommended). Or, to install it system wide, type as root:

{{{
make install
}}}

which will place a copy of the executable file in _/usr/local/bin_. Start the editor by typing:

{{{
textroom
}}}

and press F1 for help.
